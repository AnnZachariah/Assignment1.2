  This college has an E-Cell, which focuses on promoting and nurturing young entrepreneurs. The objectives of this cell are to mentor new and budding start-ups, nurturing and fostering ideas and imparting entrepreneurial skills. This cell organises several events such as Pragati and Unnati, where the college students compete with each other with their technological innovations. In 2017, this cell established a National Entrepreneurship Network, which supports student entrepreneurs, SMEs and start-ups for creating employment in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Kenya, India and Mexico. This network runs courses based on entrepreneurship along with the regular college courses.</p>
